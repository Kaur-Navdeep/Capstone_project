+ Analysis and visualization of fitbit's consumer data to guide marketing strategy for Bellabelt 
+ Used seven phases of data analysis that ask, prepare, process, analysis, visualization, share and act to form recommendations for the company.
+ Fitbit data set was extracted from the kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).
+ The data has been analyzed in R software in the file names __Case_study.Rmd__
## Recommendations based on the analysis
* Fitbit data is from a watch and it has been reported that 45.93% of time, the participants were wearing the device less than 20 hours per day. This indicates that wearing a watch all the time is not feasible. Bellabelt can use this data to highlight the importance of __Leaf__, which is easy to wear. It could be worn in different forms like bracelet, necklace and clips. Waterproof products may also help the customers to collect there 24 hours data and provide more insights into their health conditions.
* Also we have noticed that there is high correlation (above 0.7) between calories burnt per day and total steps per day, total distance covered per day and very active distance covered per day. The company can use this data to attract customers, that by keeping the track of distance and steps, will help customers get motivated to do more workout and burn calories. 
* Also based on the data, we have noticed that 40 % of the people take more than 30 mins to fall asleep and 62.5% people have BMI more than 24.5, which could be a health concern. Therefore using a device such as __Leaf__ will help customers track there sleeping behavior and health related data. Customers can then make informed decisions based on the data.
* Company can target Sundays and let people know that on average people take less steps and burn less calories on Sundays. Company could target in their marketing that Sundays could be used to work on improving health. 
* Increase in the sampling size for weight and other data could have provided better insights into the effect of daily activities on weight, BMI, and heart rate. This could also be used to guide maketing strategy.
